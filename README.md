# Linear-Regression-Model-for-head-brain

Comparison of linear regression manually and scikit-learn

description:

The dataset contains measurements related to head size and brain weight, categorized by gender and age range :

Gender:
	This column indicates the gender of the individuals. It seems to be encoded as numerical values, where 1 could represent one gender (e.g., male) and 2 could represent another gender (e.g., female).
 
Age Range:
	This column categorizes the individuals into different age ranges. The numerical values here suggest different age groups, although the exact ranges aren’t specified in the snippet. For instance, 1 might represent a specific age range (e.g., 20-30 years), 2 another range (e.g., 31-40 years), etc.
 
Head Size (cm³):
		This column provides the head size measurements in cubic centimeters. It’s a continuous numerical variable.
 
Brain Weight (grams):
	•	This column provides the brain weight measurements in grams. It’s also a continuous numerical variable.
